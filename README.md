# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

My name is Fred, and my goal with these koans is to help you figure out if you like developing. If you like developing, you'll keep at it no matter how badly you suck at first, how slow you learn, how much better other people are at it than you at first, and eventually you will become good at it.

Your goals might not be the same as mine.

Maybe you're a project manager who wants to understand when the neckbeards she works with are shining her on. Or you're in prison literally, or just figuratively, looking for something to pass the time: An enlisted sailor taking watch on a nuclear submarine, trying to keep awake; a bartender with too much college debt; one of those emo kids in high school who hates football players and cheerleaders, and wears axe body spray, and vapes in the bathroom between classes; a Dad with three kids by two different baby Mommas, who doesn't want to spend the rest of his life on food stamps. Maybe you're homeless. Or shit, maybe you're a beauty-queen-trophy-wife who has always been quiet, and perfect, and who nobody ever thought was smart enough, but yesterday someone threw shade on your Jimmy Choo's, and now you're going to show that ugly slut what is the mothafuckin what. I don't care what your goal is, and the code you write for these machines will care not at all.

Code doesn't give a shit. It either works or it doesn't, that's all.

We won't care how old you are, where you live, what car you drive, what your SAT score is, or if you're good at math or science. Speaking of machines, almost any machine running OSX, Windows or Linux flavor with an Internet connection will do. You won't need a credit card, and you don't need to be smart. Let me type that again:

You don't need to be smart.

What you do need is a few hour-long blocks of uninterrupted time to get started, a good attitude, a bit of unhealthy curiosity, some obsessiveness, some stubborn, the ability to pay attention to detail, the ability to focus -- Adderall and coffee are amazing -- the humility to ask people for help when you're stuck, and a little bit of anger. Because this tutorial and these koans are hard, and computers and software and other developers will make you feel stupid. They make me feel inadequate every day. I wish I knew how to help you learn this stuff without making you feel stupid. All I know is that if you finish these koans, nobody will be happier for you than me.

Not even your Mom.

### koans

What's a koan? Here's one definition of a koan that seems legit:

> a paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment

I'm no zen buddhist monk and don't want you to abandon reason, but I dislike lecturing -- that's not how I learn -- and so I'm going to give you a problem to solve, and let you figure out how to solve it on your own, and when you've solved it you can move onto the next koan. I'm not going to teach you anything, you're going to teach yourself.

If you're having trouble with a koan, look for the blue link to "reflect" on it further.

### Your first koan

The site you're reading these koans on is all about managing different versions or branches of a code base -- or any group of files -- known as a repository. The koans are organized into different chapters which, not coincidentally, correspond to different versions of the code in our repository. Click around to get a feel for the site, and when you've figured out how to change the "branch" of this repository to "chapter-1," go ahead and change it.
